  Hey dev's, this is Nitish, an enthusiastic developer trying to impress myself, but really, I'm here to make some code magic happen! When I'm not chasing bugs or refactoring legacy code, you can find me working on exciting side projects, experimenting with new tech stacks, and dreaming up the next big thing. 

  Fluent in Python, C and the occasional caffeine-fueled ramble( just like every other dev's out there ). 



  
ðŸ’» Tech I'm Currently Diving Into:

Frontend: React.js

Backend: Node.js, Express, Flask, REST API

Databases: MongoDB, MySQL

Other Fun Stuff: Automation( using **zapier** ), DevOps basics, and trying my best to keep up with the latest in AI/ML ( also **TransferML** ). !
